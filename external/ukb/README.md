# Notes on UKBiobank Pipeline

#### Getting Data

We assume you have access to the UKBiobank and can access raw data through their [AMS portal](https://bbams.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ams/)

Here's a quick step-by-step for getting the UKB data (i.e. ```ukbXXXXX.enc```): 
1. Log-in to [AMS portal](https://bbams.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ams/)
2. Navigate to ```Projects >> View/Update >> Data >> Data refresh or download >> Dataset```
3. Click on the ```Basket ID``` with all of your data.   
    _N.B.:_ If your data is broken up into multiple baskets, its worth using the UKB portal to combine them into a single large basket.
4. Plug in the MD5 checksum that was e-mailed to you by the UKB Team. 
5. Place the ```ukbXXXXX.enc``` file in your project directory. 
6. Make sure to put your UKB key file in the same directory, with a nice sensible name like ```ukbXXXXX.key```
